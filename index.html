                The restaurant/bakery was opened in 2008 by Gloria and Lucho, a couple who immigrated to the US from
                Peru. Over the past year, La Casa de los Antojitos has grown into one of the most traditional Colombian
                bakeries in Queens. After a couple years, lunch and dinner was added to the menu. It started with only
                Colombian food,
                and later Peruvian food was put on the menu. La Casa de los Antojitos is located at Jackson Heights in
                Queens, NY. In here you could find yourself pleasure with different kinds of sweets, breakfast, lunch,
                and dinner. To eliminate drunk arguments, it was made into an alcohol-free restaurant.
